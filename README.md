Model Development / Evaluation / Deployment:<br>
We use scikit, the python package for statistical analysis and data mining (predictive analytics)

Model Validation: <br>
• split validation (70% of the original data as training and the other 30% as testing dataset)<br>
• cross validation (90% of the original data as training and the other 10% as testing dataset)

Multiple Regression using Statsmodels:<br>
scikit for machine learning (model deployment and prediction)<br>
Statsmodels for traditional statistical analysis (causual analysis and explanation); offers p-value (statistical significance testing)
